When building modern web applications with Next.js, developers often face a crucial decision: should they use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)? Both rendering strategies offer distinct advantages, and understanding their differences is key to making the right architectural choice for your project.

## Understanding SSR and SSG in Next.js

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** generates HTML on the server for each request. In Next.js, you implement SSR by using `getServerSideProps` in your page components.

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data`);
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}
```

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** generates HTML at build time. Next.js provides `getStaticProps` for static generation:

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data`);
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data }, revalidate: 60 };
}
```

## When to Choose SSR

1. **Frequently Updated Data**: When your page displays data that changes often and needs to be up-to-date for every request
2. **User-Specific Content**: For pages that show personalized content based on cookies or authentication
3. **SEO for Dynamic Content**: When you need search engines to crawl content that changes frequently

## When to Choose SSG

1. **Performance Critical Applications**: SSG pages load faster as they're pre-rendered and can be served via CDN
2. **Content That Rarely Changes**: For blogs, documentation, marketing pages, etc.
3. **Better Scalability**: Static files are easier to cache and distribute globally

## Hybrid Approaches

Next.js allows combining both strategies in what's called Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data`);
  const data = await res.json();

  return { 
    props: { data },
    // Re-generate the page at most once every 60 seconds
    revalidate: 60 
  };
}
```

This approach gives you the benefits of SSG with the ability to update content periodically without rebuilding the entire site.

## Performance Considerations

- **SSG**: Faster initial page loads, better caching, lower server load
- **SSR**: Slower initial response (TTFB), but always shows fresh data
- **ISR**: Balances both, with fast cached responses and background updates

## Making the Decision

Consider these factors when choosing:

1. **Content Update Frequency**: How often does your data change?
2. **Traffic Patterns**: Do you expect high traffic that would benefit from caching?
3. **User Personalization**: Does the content vary significantly per user?
4. **SEO Requirements**: How important is having the absolute latest content in search results?

For most applications, a combination of both approaches works best. Use SSG for most pages and SSR only where absolutely necessary. Next.js's flexibility allows you to mix both strategies on a page-by-page basis, giving you the optimal balance of performance and freshness.
